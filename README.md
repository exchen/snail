At snail's pace, a project to include many technologies

I plan to create a project exercising many of the following technologies:

JSF2/Primefaces
Spring Rest
Spring Security
Spring Data
Mongo DB
Hadoop
Spark
Storm
Tomcat 7

Initial idea is to create a GUI for big data scheduling submission and visualization.
